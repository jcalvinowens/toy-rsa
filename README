This is a written-from-scratch toy implementation of RSA, written in 2014 and
occasionally tweaked since.

It's obviously useless for any practical application: the point is to be a very
simple and easy to understand BIGNUM library with an RSA implementation.

Division is implemented as shift-and-subtract, so it's very very slow.
